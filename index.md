This website hosts a three-part series offered by T-CAIREM to provide learners with a comprehensive introduction to data science in the Python programming language.
This content is unique in that it is specifically designed for people who aim to use data science in healthcare.
All of the programming is done in [Python](https://www.python.org/), but the concepts covered in these parts should generalize to other popular programming languages.
Most of the lectures center around interactive [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) hosted on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), allowing learners to work with code in real time with minimal setup requirements on their computers.

This content may be offered through multiple concurrent programs at any given time, so the sections below provide specific details related to these offerings.
